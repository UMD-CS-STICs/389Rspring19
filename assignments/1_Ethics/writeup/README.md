## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)
The task that was assigned to me as a junior developer at a large automotive manufacturer was to audit the Engine Control Unitâ€™s (ECU) firmware for security issues. After six months of auditing, I concluded that the current ECU firmware has several complex problems and these problems could be fixed with a timeframe of six months. I would inform my boss of these issues because he or she would have the authority to acquire additional funds to pay or hire a team of twenty developers. It is better to fix the problem right now rather than wait until customers start using the product. If the problems arise while the customers start using the product, the company could lose customers in sense of the customer losing their life or customers losing interest in the company's products. If the company is unwilling to wait an additional 6 months to fix the bugs that I found, I would have to quit my job and inform the public because my conscious would hunt me because I know the harm the product could do if it is released without a fix. If I do nothing, I should and will be responsible for the effects that the security problems bring when the product is used. As a company, it is the responsibility of the employees to make sure the products that the company produce meets the standard of the customer. Meaning the product should make life easy for the customer.
