# Operational Security and Social Engineering

## Assignment details

This assignment has two parts. It is due by 2/28 at 11:59 PM.

**There will be a late penalty of 5% off per day late!**

### Part 1

You have been hired by a penetration testing firm and have been asked to collect some specific information about the 1337Bank employee from HW2, Elizabeth Moffet. Some of the information you're looking for seems to be unavailable or unlikely to be found through OSINT:

- What's her mother's maiden name?
- What browser does she primarily use?
- What city was she born in?
- What's her ATM pin number?
- What was the name of her first pet?

Write up a pretext that you would use to social engineer this information out of Elizabeth Moffet. What approach would you take and how would you present yourself to elicit this information under the radar? Use the slides and what we covered in lecture to come up with a plan to obtain this information.

### Part 2

Elizabeth Moffet has recently discovered that 1337Bank's web server has been broken into by the crafty CMSC389R ethical hackers. After reading your published report, she has reached out to you to seek guidance in how she can repair some of the vulnerabilities that you have discovered.
Choose 3 specific vulnerabilities from homework 2 that you have identified (ie. exposed ports, weak passwords, etc.) and write a brief summary of some suggestions you can provide Elizabeth for the 1337Bank web server and admin server. Be as thorough as possible in your answer, use specific examples and citing online research into security techniques that could be applied to the servers (ie. firewall, IDS/IPS, password managers, etc.).

### Format

The submission should be answered in bullet form or full, grammatical sentences. It should also be stored in `assignments/3_OPSEC_SE/writeup/README.md`. Push it to your GitHub repository by the deadline.

### Scoring

Part 1 is worth 40 points, part 2 is worth 60 points. The rubric with our expectations can be found on the ELMS assignment posting.

Good luck!
