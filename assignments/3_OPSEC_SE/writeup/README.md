## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)
To elicit information from Elizabeth Moffet, I would pretent to be her bank(an agent) who calls
her to let her know that someone has used her credit/debit card to buy items. I tell her the items that were bought, then she should be able to comfirm
that she did not buy those items because I made it up. I tell her the next step is that we cancel the card. I then
tell her the process of getting a new card which involves comfiriming her information like her address including 
information of secret questions.  


### Part 2 (60 pts)
Vunrubilies I found include the username used, open ports, and weak passwords. The username Elizabeth use for her work 
work login should not be her twitter handle. This increase the possiblity of a hacker gaining access to the server in 
which she also uses a weak password. I suggest that Elizabeth use stronger passwords and encourage her employees do the
same and also use professinal usernames. The company should also invest in fairwalls to help against open ports 
lessening the chances of a hacker getting theough the banks server.
